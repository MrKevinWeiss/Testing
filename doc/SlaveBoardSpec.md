- Multi master I2C

# FAQs
### Why not use a tool (like buspirate) that does this already?
- Standard test tools from DIOLAN and Total Phase require licenses and are expensive
- Most tools don't achieve everything needed, that is why it would be good to customize firmware

### Why not just test against sensors?
- Sensors and other slave devices cannot test all configurable modes (try to find a SPI MODE 3 or 4 device)

### Why not use a Raspberry Pi?
- RPi does not support low level testing
- RPi's drivers are not well certified

### Why not use Arduino?
- Standard Arduino extensions don't support all configurable features well
- Arduino hardware doesn't support everything

### Why not implement in RIOT or any other OS?
- If the device is using RIOT then it shouldn't be tested on RIOT, it should be tested against an accepted reference
- The tester should be minimal to not introduce unnecessary overhead
- RIOT doesn't support many slave features


### Are the peripheral pins static or reassignable?
- Pins are static, this makes them simple to wire and simple to develop

### Why program for only one board and not make it usable on other boards?
- Lots of code takes advantage of hardware specific features
- Certification becomes simpler, only need to certify one boards
- Documentation and wiring become simpler
- The board should be easy to obtain so it is not necessary to depend on boards that are lying around

### What happens if the bluepill board become obsolete?
- This can happen to any board
- The bluepill board is very simple to recreate (mcu, crystals, button, leds, connectors)
- The nucleo-f103rb can also be used with a change in pinout if usb is not used

### Why program the BPT bare metal (or using STMCube)?
- STMCube provides a standard reference to start so boilerplate code doesn't need to be implemented, tested, and debugged
- Bare metal is used since the application features are generally simple and an RTOS is not needed
- If alterations are made in the future it is not necessary to update or bring in a new RTOS

### How dependant is the bpt on the library (STMCube and CMSIS)?

# Shell Communication Protocol
## Introduction
The BPT will have a register based protocol, see [memory map](bpt_mem_map.csv) for information on the registers.  All interfaces (UART, USB, I2C, SPI) will access the registers (with different access levels).

## Shell Interface Description
The shell interface can be accessed either through UART1 or the devices USB, both have the same protocol.
