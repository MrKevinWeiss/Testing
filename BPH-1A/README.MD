# BPH (Bluepill HAT)

This is a PCB for connecting a Raspberry Pi 3B to a bluepill and a 20 pin output for the DUT (Device Under Test).  It has some protection for 5V boards, power measurement hardware, and some power control (powering on/off USB or external power).  The PCB was created with Circuit Maker and is available [here](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Kevin-Weiss-2/bph).
